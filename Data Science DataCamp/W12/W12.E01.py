import numpy as np

#The input data has been pre-loaded as input_data, and the weights are available in a dictionary called weights. The array of weights for the first node in the hidden layer are in weights['node_0'], and the array of weights for the second node in the hidden layer are in weights['node_1'].

#The weights feeding into the output node are available in weights['output'].

#NumPy will be pre-imported for you as np in all exercises.

# Calculate node 0 value: node_0_value
node_0_value = (input_data * weights['node_0']).sum()

# Calculate node 1 value: node_1_value
node_1_value = (input_data * weights['node_1']).sum()

# Put node values into array: hidden_layer_outputs
hidden_layer_outputs = np.array([node_0_value, node_1_value])

# Calculate output: output
output = (hidden_layer_outputs * weights['output']).sum()

# Print output
print(output)
